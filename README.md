# Serverless esbuild starter template

A production read starter template for building applications using Serverless Framework.

A fairly opinionated template that will allow you to quickly build serverless services using Typescript.

## What this is

A starting point to quickly build and deploy serverless applications.

Functions are written in Typescript and deployed to AWS.

## What this isn't

A framework - plenty already exist for you to use if you wish.

## What's included?

- AWS specific Serverless Framework configuration.
- Serverless Compose
- Functions split into services - no huge lambda functions.
- Bundlod, packaged and minified using esbuild.
- Serverless Offline - run services locally.
- Unit tests
